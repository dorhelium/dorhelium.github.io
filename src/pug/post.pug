                            | I left my roots when I was 17. Since then I’ve been on the move - moving homes, moving cities. In the past 9 years, I've had 8 different homes, ranging from several months to almost 3 years. This is more than a few, less than many, each one a chapter of its own. 


                        p.paragraph
                            | I’ve always taken pride in being a free spirit. Packing up my life, setting out to create something new, building a home, searching for a community, finding a sense of belonging; and then with or without my will, packing again, selling things, letting go, starting over, again and again, have become a cycle that repeats every time. As I step further into this journey, I notice something subtly shifts inside of me. With each new place, the connections grow a little deeper, the imprints sink in a little more. With every place, every person, I realize I’ve built a part of who I am. But it also comes with greater confusion. The goodbyes are hard, leaving takes courage, but why am I still looking for the next thing?

                        p.paragraph 
                            | I truly believe that the cities we live in our 20s - whether for a few months or a few years - have the power to shape the very essence of who we are. The two most recent cities I’ve lived in have both been life-affirming.


                        p.paragraph 
                            | Two years in Toronto have evoked a calm confidence in me. Toronto is a place that pulses with ambition and possibility. But unlike NYC or London, the energy is electric yet somehow still laid-back. Dreams feel within reach, but there’s also an undercurrent of urgency that keeps you striving, pushing, and growing. Years after leaving my roots, gradually building a solid foundation in Canada and a support network, Toronto has become the “home” that gave me the courage to define what I desire, and the confidence to believe that I am actually capable of it. Despite all that, I find myself yearning for something else, searching for something I couldn’t fully grasp.

                        p.paragraph 
                            | That void started to uncover a little in Paris. A few months in Paris has been one of the most soul-expanding experiences of my life so far. Let me explain. I have been quite disengaged from any cultural, intellectual or philosophical pursuit. For the majority of my life, I’ve been trained to focus on my own experience, the present moment, and my practical desires. That broader sense of existence has been mostly ignored.


                        p.paragraph 
                            | My favorite thing to do in Paris is to take ridiculously long walks. The idea of one word keeps finding its way to me -  


                        span.caption.text-muted.fst-italic  Gravity. 

                        p.paragraph    
                            | This city with its radial concentric urban designs, densely built streets, Haussmann architectures, romantic gardens, centuries-old monuments and bridges, has an enduring weightiness to it. Walking through the city, each step feels as though I am walking on footprints of generations before me - the philosophers, revolutionaries, artists, and thinkers. Everything carries layers of meaning, and that meaning carries weight, almost sacred in its richness and complexity. You sense that you’re part of a larger story, one that continues to unfold, but is also deeply anchored in the past. If one spends enough time here, it’s inevitable to experience an appreciation and introspection of some sorts. The solipsistic me suddenly finds myself craving for more moral and intellectual growth.

                        p.paragraph 
                            | The unspoken way of life is also in contrast to what I’m used to in North America. Rather than prioritize hustle, status and wealth, the people I’ve met in France place greater value on community, flow, arts, and the beauty of all forms. What a rich way to experience life.
