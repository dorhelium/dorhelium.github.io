                            | Hello friends.
                        p
                            | If you somehow arrived here, I want to give you a big hug first. Welcome to this little space that was born out of a rush of throughts on a random Wednesday night.

                            | As the title suggests, this is where I capture the whispers of my inner magnetic north from my mind and my heart. It is constantly evolving, certainly not perfect, but the journey is to be cherished.
